title: Keeping Translations Up-to-date
issue: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21250
---

Periodically, gatsbybot will update your translation repo to be up-to-date with the current English repo. If there is an update to a page that is already translated, gatsbybot will create a pull request listing the conflicts between translation and the new English content. Resolving these conflicts and merging these pull requests is essential to keeping your translation repo up-to-date. See the next section for instructions on how to resolve and merge sync PRs.

#### Resolving sync pull requests

The PRs generated by gatsbybot will list files that have conflicts between translated content and English content. These updates will appear as Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`).

You may resolve these conflicts however you feel comfortable: through the GitHub UI, from the command line, or with a code editor like VS Code. See the [Common types of merge issues](#common-types-of-merge-issues) section for how to resolve various conflicts.

#### Manually syncing translation repos

If for whatever reason you'd like to manually sync your translation repo, you can do so by running these commands:

```shell
git remote add source https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-i18n-source.git
git pull source master
```

Fix all [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line) and create a pull request to finish the merge.

### Common types of merge issues

#### Typos fixes

Sometimes there is a typo or a grammatical change in the English source that gets fixed in an update. Since these typos most likely don't exist in the translated version, you can most likely use the translated version as-is.

#### Formatting changes

Sometimes the only difference is a change in formatting, like, such as adding back-ticks to annotate something as code, or emphasizing certain words:

```diff
- Sass files have the extension .scss.
+ Sass files have the extension `.scss`.
```

The only necessary change is to ensure the translated content carries over these formatting updates.

#### Link updates

These changes involve updating the URL of a link:

```diff
- Please see our [plugins page](/packages).
+ Please see our [plugins page](/plugins).
```

Resolve these changes by updating the link.

#### Content changes

Sometimes, the content of the source page is actually updated and needs a translation. Make sure to read the change carefully and change the translation to match its meaning.
